It should be selected on the basis of being the best measure of the main outcome of interest in the study. It will also have special status in the study, for example in reporting the findings and in setting the sample sizes. As well as the primary outcome measure, secondary outcome measures can be selected for a number of reasons: Establishing the effectiveness of intervention at delivering other benefits besides the primary target; Assessing the extent of any adverse outcomes; Monitoring the intermediate outcomes to assess the propagation of the impact of the intervention along the causal chain; Assessing the effectiveness of the intervention at timepoints other than the primary timepoint of interest; Collecting an alternative measure for compatibility with other studies.")}}

Where a new intervention is being studied, the minimum practically important difference might be informed by the amount by which it would have to outperform the existing standard approach to be worth considering deploying. As well as the difference itself, record how the number was arrived at. Establishing the minimum practically important difference may require a small qualitative piece of research with decision-makers in the implementing organisation to identify. Having an accurate impression of the minimum practically important difference is particularly important for the primary outcome as this will be the main factor affecting how large the sample sizes need to be for the study.")}}
