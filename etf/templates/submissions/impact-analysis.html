If the outcome is measured as a quantity that is meaningful in practice, the differences between mean levels of this quantity will also typically be something meaningful.

If you are intending to conduct a subgroup analysis, it will normally be necessary to ensure that the sample size for that subgroup is large enough.",
        "Particular caution should be exercised over subgroup analyses that are specified after the data have been seen. A common mistake in studies is that if an intervention appears unsuccessful for the population as a whole, researchers can go 'fishing' through the data to find any subset of people it does work for. This is invariably a mistake because there will typically be some way of slicing the population that shows a positive outcome just by random variation."])}}
