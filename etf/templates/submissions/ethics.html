        If so, is this being used as the comparison intervention for any new intervention being studied, 
        rather than using a no-service comparison group?",
        "One of the main justifications for it being ethical to undertake a study is that there exists a state of 
        ‘equipoise’ – ie that there is a degree of uncertainty about which of the options being compared is superior. 
        If an intervention has already conclusively been shown to be effective then it would normally be ethically 
        problematic to compare it to a control group receiving nothing. It would, however, still be acceptable to 
        test it against another intervention of unknown effectiveness, or to compare it against ‘no treatment’ in a 
        new context where it is not yet known whether the intervention would be effective.",
        "One exception to the requirement for equipoise can be a situation where there is a natural delay: where 
        the intervention would be rolled out in a phased way to different beneficiaries anyway, then it can be 
        ethical to conduct a study comparing those who get the intervention early against those who have not yet 
        received it because they are due to get it later."])}}
