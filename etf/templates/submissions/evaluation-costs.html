      Enter the costs associated with the evaluation, broken down however makes sense for your project.

      You can just enter 'Whole evaluation' as the item and then the total cost as the associated cost if you just want to record the total cost of the evaluation.

      Another option would be to break it down by years, eg 'Evaluation costs in year 1', 'Evaluation costs in year 2', etc.
