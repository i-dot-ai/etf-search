      <p>You can just enter 'Whole evaluation' as the item and then the total cost as the associated cost if you just want to record the total cost of the evaluation.</p>

      <p>Another option would be to break it down by years, eg 'Evaluation costs in year 1', 'Evaluation costs in year 2', etc.</p>
