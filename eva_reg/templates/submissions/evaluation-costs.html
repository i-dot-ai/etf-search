            <p>If you just want to record the <b>total cost</b> of the evaluation, enter 'Whole evaluation' as the item and then the total cost as the associated cost.</p>
            
            <p>If you want to record information about parts of the overall cost, you can break it down however makes sense for your project.</p>

            <p>One option is to break the costs down by <b>time period</b>, such as by years or by quarters. In this case, the cost items could simply be 'Evaluation costs in year 1', 'Evaluation costs in year 2', etc.</p>

            <p>Another option is to break the costs down by <b>types of activity</b>, for example adding cost items for 'Evaluation fieldwork', 'Evaluation analysis', etc.</p>

            <p>If you do break the costs down, feel free to include an entry for 'Other costs' to include anything not covered in your specific costed items.</p>
